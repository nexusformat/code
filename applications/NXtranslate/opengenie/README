NXtranslate interface to ISIS Open GENIE package using the dynamic interface
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Note: There is currently a problem with activating "genie.so" dynamically -
to make it work you need to have genie linked into the nxtranslate 
exectuable which you do by adding   -lgenie   to the   nxtranslate_LDADD  
line in the Makefile.am file; then rebuild nxtranslate

To run the test, type

       make test_opengenie.nxs

in the NXtranslate directory - this will read the test_opengenie.xml
configuration file and generate the requested output file


Usage
-----

The module is loaded  via the NXtranslate NXS:mime_type="dynamic/libnxgenie.so"
On loading, additional GCL commands can be installed by setting the 
NXGENIE_INIT environment variable to point at the relevant file

see test_opengenie.xml for an example of usage
