+ Add support for MarkFollowing
+ Add unit tests for partitioning
+ Do something useful with Mode properties
  + Use the mode properties to drive the AutoIndentStrategy
+ Add better support for delegates. Right now a span contained within
another span does not work. Delegates employ this concept very
often. I think this will be quite a bit of work to fix sense you will
need to reimplement a lot of the eclipse classes because they mostly
all assume that you don't have overlapping content types. It may be
possible to fake with a special damager.
+ Create better default colors :-)
+ Add preference listeners so editor updates on color preference changes.
