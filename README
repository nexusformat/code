DISCLAIMER
==========

The code in this repository is maintained as a community effort, 
mainly for the sake of existing installations and for some of the tools.
The NeXus API (NAPI) as is probably not the best choice for new projects.
In many cases a direct interface to HDF5, which is the preferred backend,
provides more features, stability and support. 

Here is a link to the relevant section in the documentation:

You are welcome to proceed and use this code and the tools though.

Installation Instructions
=========================

Unix (including Mac OS X) source distribution
---------------------------------------------

If you have downloaded a source distribution (e.g. nexus-4.3.0.tar.gz) then 
you will already have a file called "configure" and the basic sequence to follow is:

    ./configure  # use    sh ./configure    if this does not work
    make
    make check
    make install

this may not, however, build all the nexus utilities and binding you require, 
and may also locate the wrong HDF libraries and final installation directory. 
Thus you will probably need to pass some options to "configure" to control this.

General information about "configure" is located in the file called INSTALL

To see a list of possible options type

    ./configure --help

HDF libraries used by nexus are available via your system software package 
manager or can be downloaded from http://www.hdfgroup.org/

A typical run of configure might be:

    ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/nexus --with-hdf5=/usr/local/hdf5

Unix (including Mac OS X) git checkout
--------------------------------------

As the "configure" file mentioned is a generated file, it is not included 
in the version control checkout. To create it run:

   sh autogen.sh

and then follow the same procedure as above. You may also want to look 
at the README.developers file
